# Server hosting tutorial

* Run make_server.bat (or run Server.exe if exist).
* Open port 9090 on your PC.
* Share your ip this way: `<YOUR IP>:9090`.
* You can use `127.0.0.1:9090` if you planning to use it only on your PC.
* You can use local ip to play with people at same network.

## If you dont want to share your ip:

* Sign up in [ngrok](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup).
* Download it, follow step 1 and 2 on page shown.
* Run `ngrok.exe tcp 9090` (assuming you are at same directory as executable).
* Run make_server.bat (or run Server.exe if exist).
* Your server is running! Share ip after `Forwarding` line (ignoring `tcp://`)
